possible future dev :
Public key saved on the root folder. Secrets hold the private key. 
gitactions for signed transactions. 
each file is signed by the owner 
PR with multiple reviewers = multisig 
code owners = wallet owners
issues - requests for payments
pages - like a single address webpage of ethscan
transaction  = commit
all repos are public and  "verifiers" repos pull their history and save it. if a user pushes -f and changes his wallet history- he is banned/black listed. 

claude - udnerstand the idea and expend to fully operational centralized ledger with proof of history
then write a professional white paper for it in a dedicated folder
